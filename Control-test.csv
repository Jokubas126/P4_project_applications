","The interface that the person was using, it was slow and clunky + weird sound effects. The head movement of the person actually wearing the VR set when the video was made were distracting. The fact that the lines were pretty much the same in both videos. The animation, it's unreal and the people are stiff and the fact that the things the acting person is doing makes no sense, I have no idea what this case is about so how can I get pulled into this reality? Also the dad is in the room, that's not appropriate, why is he there? I can't see the kid up close, nursing isn't just seeing values on a monitor we use our senses to asses as well. None of that is here. ","Sorry to be so negative but none of this makes me feel like I'm in the room. That's not what a hospital looks like (marble floors dont help btw) or how hospital staff act/work together. "
